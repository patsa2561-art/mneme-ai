## [0.13.0] — 2026-05-05

The **"Black Sheep"** release. Closes every gap from the landscape
research:

| Gap | Tool that came closest | What was missing | Mneme v0.13 |
|-----|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|
| OSS  | — | many tools were closed-source | ✅ MIT |
| Real-time | Goursome (dead 2014) | nothing actively maintained | ⏳ planned watch mode |
| Semantic NLP clustering | arxiv 2110.00697 | research-only | ✅ `mneme cluster` |
| Author network with semantic edges | Unblocked.com (closed, paid) | no OSS | ✅ `mneme network` |
| Predictive overlay | MergeBERT (research) | not productized | ✅ already shipped in `oracle` |
| Exportable developer fingerprint | HowYouCode (snapshot only) | no history-derived | ✅ already shipped in `dna` |
| Universal codebase export | — | no tool bundles everything | ✅ `mneme export-bundle` |
| Engineering management view | — | no tool combines health + succession | ✅ `mneme manage` |

After v0.13 there is **no commercial or open-source tool that does what
Mneme does as a single, local-first artifact.** That is the "Black
Sheep" position — alone in the field by design.

### Added — four new commands

- **`mneme cluster`** — semantic clustering of commit messages. Groups
  similar commits (token-overlap or embedding-based when available),
  surfaces topic islands, returns cohesion + sample commits +
  cluster-defining vocabulary. **First shipped CLI for semantic commit
  clustering — academic papers stop at the paper.** 9 tests.
- **`mneme network`** — author social graph with **semantic edges**.
  Edges aren't just "edited same file"; they're weighted by co-edit +
  co-time + co-topic, and labeled with the shared vocabulary. Detects
  silos (connected components) and bridges (authors connecting them).
  **Closes the OSS gap left by closed-source competitors.** 7 tests.
- **`mneme manage`** — engineering management dashboard. Combines
  drift, oracle, and per-area touch data into a single CTO/EM-friendly
  view: team health composite, succession plan per area (primary +
  understudy + risk), skill matrix, action notes. **No tool combines
  these into one frame.** 8 tests.
- **`mneme export-bundle`** (alias `bundle`) — universal codebase
  export. Bundles every Mneme analysis — DNA × top contributors, drift,
  chronicle, oracle, constellation, clusters, network, manage, ghost —
  into a single shareable artifact (JSON + Markdown). Run once, ship to
  collaborators or attach to release notes. 6 tests.

### Test count

| Category | Tests |
|----------|-------|
| Cluster | 9 |
| Network | 7 |
| Manage | 8 |
| Export bundle | 6 |
| **Total new in v0.13** | **30** |
| Repo total | 727 |

Build clean. All 727 tests pass.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-05-05

The **"King of Git"** release. Five new world-first commands, each
addressing a question that no other tool can answer about your
codebase's past, present, or future. After landscape research (Gource,
code_swarm, Hercules, Unblocked, HowYouCode, MergeBERT) confirmed each
one occupies whitespace.

### Added — five killer commands

- **`mneme dna [author]`** — extract a portable, exportable **Codebase
  DNA** fingerprint of any contributor: their style genome (file-per-
  commit, test ratio, conventional commit ratio), message DNA (subject
  length, imperative ratio, top verbs), working hours (UTC histogram,
  peak window, weekend ratio), and file affinity (top dirs, top
  extensions). Includes `--compare <author>` for two-way DNA similarity
  scoring and `--output <file>` for JSON export. **No other tool ships
  history-derived, comparable, exportable per-developer fingerprints.**
  13 tests.
- **`mneme drift`** — visualize **topical drift** of a repo over time
  (default: quarter buckets). Classifies each commit as feature /
  refactor / firefight / polish / docs / other, then plots the per-
  bucket distribution as a colored sparkline. Detects burnout signals,
  recovery, rewrite clusters, and polish streaks. **NLP-grade commit
  classification has been published in academic papers but never
  shipped as a CLI before.** 13 tests.
- **`mneme chronicle`** — auto-generate a **chaptered narrative
  documentary** of your codebase. Detects natural epochs, names each
  chapter ("The Founding", "The Great Refactor", "The Reckoning"),
  identifies the protagonist (top contributor), and emits Markdown
  ready to convert to PDF / EPUB. `--output CHRONICLE.md` writes the
  novel. 10 tests.
- **`mneme oracle`** — **predictive co-edit oracle**. From the recent
  window of commits, builds a recency-weighted author × file affinity
  matrix, then projects probabilities for the next window. Surfaces
  predicted *collisions* (two authors both likely to touch the same
  file) so teams can sync before they merge-conflict. **MergeBERT
  research stopped at the paper; Mneme ships the productized version.**
  8 tests.
- **`mneme constellation`** — build a **graph view of the repo** as a
  living map: files are stars (size = touches), authors are orbital
  bodies, commits are edges. Includes co-edit edges between files
  committed together and authorship edges between authors and the files
  they orbit. JSON exportable for the planned WebGL viewer
  (`mneme constellation --serve` in v1.0). 9 tests.

### Test count

| Category | Tests |
|----------|-------|
| DNA | 13 |
| Drift | 13 |
| Chronicle | 10 |
| Oracle | 8 |
| Constellation | 9 |
| **Total new in v0.12** | **53** |
| Repo total | 697 |

Build clean. All 697 tests pass.

### Numbers — what's now in Mneme

| Surface | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Tier-1 essentials | 8 |
| Insight commands | 16 |
| Quant commands | 10 |
| WILD commands | 11 |
| MCP tools | 7 |

## [0.11.1] — 2026-05-05

Maintenance release for MCP Registry publish:

- Added `mcpName` field to `mneme-ai` package.json
  (`io.github.patsa2561-art/mneme-ai`) for npm verification.
- Added `server.json` manifest at repo root for `mcp-publisher`.
- **Mneme is now live in the official MCP Registry**:
  https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/

## [0.11.0] — 2026-05-05

The "Time Loops & Ghosts" release. Three new world-first commands that
lean on the same indexed memory but answer different questions:

> *Where has this file been?*
> *What is my repo's history saying about this idea?*
> *What is haunting my codebase?*

### Added — three new insights

- **`mneme time-machine <file>`** — narrate a file's evolution as discrete
  eras (birth, rewrite, evolution, firefight, polish, plateau, twilight).
  Emits a per-era label ("rewrite — 'switched to streams' (412 lines)"),
  a per-era churn count, and a "health" tri-ratio (rewrite vs firefight
  vs polish). Uses commit-message keywords + churn thresholds to classify.
  10 tests.
- **`mneme premortem <intent>`** — given a proposed change, mine the repo
  for similar past attempts (token-overlap similarity + path hint), then
  walk forward in a window for revert/hotfix/incident/rewrite signals.
  Produces a regret probability, a verdict tier (low/medium/high/very_high),
  and the top three risks with citations to the actual commits that
  exhibited them. **Predictive analysis grounded in YOUR repo's failure
  history**, not generic AI advice. 11 tests.
- **`mneme ghost`** — surfaces "ghost code": files that haunt the repo
  without doing anything. Combines staleness (recency-decay), low-touch
  ratio (born and forgotten), and TODO density into a single ghostliness
  score. Also detects stale TODOs — markers added long ago and ignored
  through later edits. 10 tests.

### Added — auto-discovery + SEO

- **`keywords`** in npm package.json expanded to cover memory, MCP, AI
  coding assistant, codebase intelligence — improves npm search ranking
  without changing the user-facing description.
- **GitHub topics** added to repo: `mcp`, `mcp-server`,
  `ai-coding-assistant`, `codebase-memory`, `git-archaeology`,
  `local-first`, `typescript`. Topic search → Mneme.

### Test count

| Category | Tests |
|----------|-------|
| Time machine | 10 |
| Pre-mortem | 11 |
| Ghost | 10 |
| **Total new** | **31** |
| Repo total | 644 |

Build green. All 644 tests pass.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-05

The "Super Saiyan" release. v0.9.0 ships in three sprints on top of the
earlier hardening work, turning Mneme from "raw retrieval" into an
answer-shaped experience.

### Added — Sprint 1: engine + output

- **Intent classifier** (`retrieve/intent`) — every query is classified
  as `specific` / `lookup` / `temporal` / `vague` *before* retrieval. Vague
  queries ("how to improve my code") short-circuit with a redirect message
  instead of returning low-confidence guesses. 21 tests.
- **Adaptive confidence** — `classifyConfidence(results)` returns one of
  `high` / `medium` / `low` / `none` based on top score AND the gap to
  top-2/3. Tied results (all ≈ 0.016) drop to "low" even when the
  absolute top is decent. The previous static floor stays as a hard cut.
- **LLM synthesis layer** (`retrieve/synthesize`) — turns top-K results
  into a 2-4 sentence answer that cites commit hashes. Falls back to an
  extractive template-based answer when no LLM is reachable. 14 tests.
- **Beautiful output** (`render-answer`) — sectioned response with
  confidence badge (🟢🟡🔴), `✦ Answer`, `◆ Evidence` (top-3 of N, not
  all N), `⊕ Files` clustered by top-2 path segments. OSC 8 hyperlinks
  make PR/commit refs clickable in modern terminals (iTerm2, Wezterm,
  Windows Terminal, VSCode). 22 tests.
- **Animated thinking spinner** (`spinner`) — braille frames during
  retrieval and synthesis. Disabled on non-TTY (CI, piped output).

### Added — Sprint 2: killer commands

- **`mneme who-knows <topic>`** — surface the people most likely to know
  about a topic, ranked by `log(commits) × recency` so one mega-contributor
  doesn't dominate. Tiers: `definitive` / `active` / `stale` / `occasional`.
- **`mneme decisions [--format markdown]`** — auto-extract architectural
  decisions from commit history. 9 patterns: `decided to`, `switched from
  A to B`, `replaced X with Y`, `chose A over B`, `use X instead of Y`,
  `adopted X`, `deprecated X`, `migrated from A to B`, `rejected X`.
  Captures rationale (`because Y`, `so that Y`).
- **`mneme stack-trace [--from F]`** — parse a JS/TS/Python/Go/Java stack
  trace and query history for each frame: last 3 commits + count of past
  incidents affecting the file. Reads stdin or a file.
- **`mneme story <topic>`** — narrate the evolution of a topic across
  acts (initial / refactor / incident / evolution / stable). Optional
  Ollama act-narration adds a 1-2 sentence prose summary per act.

### Added — Sprint 3: AI nobody-thought-existed

- **`mneme dream`** — speculative ideas grounded in your codebase patterns.
  Gathers signals (commit volume, language distribution, top modules,
  pattern suffixes like `Service`/`Adapter`) and asks an LLM to suggest
  3-5 features that fit your style. Falls back to deterministic heuristic
  ideas when no LLM is configured.
- **`mneme chat`** — multi-turn REPL with conversation context. Augments
  follow-up queries with the previous turn's question to improve retrieval.
  Slash commands: `/exit`, `/clear`, `/save <file>`, `/history`.
- **Smart suggestions in `mneme ask`** — every answer now includes a
  `→ Try next` section with up to 3 follow-up commands, generated by
  `extractTopicWord(question)` + result analysis. Heuristic, deterministic.

### Changed

- **Tests: 244 → 379** (+135 tests, +9 test files).
- **Eval A/B verified across all three sprints** — recall@3 = 87.7%,
  hit rate = 96%, negative recall = 100%. No regression.
- **CLI surface**: 8 essentials in `mneme --help`, 26 advanced via
  `mneme advanced` (was 24). Tier-2 includes the 6 new Sprint 2+3 commands.

### Numbers

| Metric | v0.9.0-pre | v0.9.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Tests passing | 244 / 24 files | **379 / 33 files** |
| Visible CLI commands | 8 | **8** (unchanged — kept clean) |
| Total CLI commands | 28 | **34** |
| Languages parsed | TS, JS, Python, Go | **TS, JS, Python, Go** |
| Eval recall@3 | 87.7% | **87.7%** (no regression across 3 sprints) |
| Killer commands | 0 | **6** (`who-knows`, `decisions`, `stack-trace`, `story`, `dream`, `chat`) |

## [0.9.0-pre] — 2026-05-04

The "honest, multi-language, self-improving" release. Five months of code in one tag.

### Added

- **Wisdom Mutant Engine** — 24/7 self-improving loop:
  - `mneme feedback <id> up|down` records explicit feedback on a query.
  - `mneme why` on a recently-returned commit acts as an implicit positive signal.
  - `mneme calibrate` runs a grid search over `(semanticWeight, minSemCosine, rrfK)` and picks the config that maximizes hit rate against accumulated feedback. Requires ≥ 10 positive examples to gate against statistical noise.
  - `mneme watch` is the daemon: re-indexes on every `.git/HEAD` change, calibrates hourly, self-evals daily.
  - Three new append-only tables: `wisdom_feedback`, `wisdom_calibration`, `wisdom_eval_run` (schema bumped to v2, additive).
- **Confidence floor** in `retrieve/search`. The system now returns `[]` (with the message *"no relevant commits or PRs were found … this usually means the WHY behind this code lives outside the git history"*) for queries with no FTS hits **and** top semantic cosine < 0.4. Negative-recall on the eval set went from 0% to 100% with no regression on positive recall.
- **Redaction layer** (`util/redact`) — regex scrubber for AWS access keys, GitHub PAT (classic + fine-grained), GitLab PAT, OpenAI/Anthropic keys, Stripe (live & test), Slack tokens, Google API keys, npm tokens, JWTs, PEM private keys, generic Bearer tokens. **ON by default** in `mneme index`. Aggressive mode (`--aggressive-redact`) catches generic `password=` patterns and long hex blobs.
- **Deterministic mode** — `--no-llm` flag, `MNEME_NO_LLM` env var, or `config.deterministic = true`. `heal` and `genius` refuse with exit code 2 + a non-LLM suggestion. `teach` falls back to layer classification only. `index` forces the hash embedder regardless of what was asked.
- **Smart environment probe** — `mneme init` and a new `mneme doctor` command detect Ollama (with embedding model pulled or not), OpenAI key presence, and hardware tier, then recommend the best embedder for THIS user.
- **Go entity parser (regex v1)** — methods (`Receiver.Name`), generics (Go 1.18+), structs, interfaces, type aliases. Comment- and raw-string-aware via masking pass. 16 tests.
- **`docs/SECURITY.md`** — full threat model. Bank-grade documentation.
- **`docs/PRIVACY.md`** — short, plain-language version for users.
- **CycloneDX SBOM** generation in the release pipeline. Attached as a 365-day artifact for every tagged release.
- **Pronunciation guide** in README — *"NEE-meh"*.
- **`mneme advanced`** — print all advanced commands (Phase 2/3/4 + WILD ideas) grouped by phase. The main `mneme --help` now shows only 8 essentials.

### Changed

- **CLI surface tiered.** `mneme --help` now shows 8 essentials (`init`, `index`, `ask`, `why`, `status`, `doctor`, `mcp`, `watch`). Twenty advanced commands are hidden from the main help and accessible via `mneme advanced`. Reduces cognitive load for new users.
- **Eval golden set: 15 → 50 questions** across 7 categories (was 4): why-question, keyword, who-when, negative, short-query, specific-ref, multi-tag.
- **Hit rate: 93.3% → 96.0%** on the new 50-question set.
- **`mneme ask`** now records every query into `wisdom_feedback` and prints a one-line CTA to upvote/downvote.
- **`mneme why`** now triggers an implicit positive signal — looking up `why` on a commit that recently appeared in an `ask` result marks that result helpful.

### Removed

- **Four stub commands removed:** `oracle`, `genome`, `dialogue`, `tribute`. They were design pages with no near-term implementation. Maintaining "coming soon" stubs is dead code and dilutes the CLI surface. If they ship later, they ship as new commands.
- **`mneme planned`** removed (was a hidden command listing the four stubs).

### Fixed

- **Schema-version meta key** is now `2` to reflect the wisdom subsystem additions.
- README, ROADMAP, and WILD_IDEAS counts now agree with each other and with the actual `npm test` output.

### Security

- All new test fixtures for the redaction layer construct token-shaped strings at runtime (e.g. `"sk" + "_live_" + "A".repeat(24)`) so GitHub's secret scanner does not flag the source files. The redaction code itself catches real-world key formats — verified by 26 unit tests.

### Numbers

| Metric | v0.8.4 | v0.9.0 |
|---|---|---|
| Tests passing | 167 / 19 files | **244 / 24 files** |
| Eval golden set | 15 questions | **50 questions** |
| Visible CLI commands | 27 (overwhelming) | **8 essentials + `advanced`** |
| Negative-case recall | 0% 🔴 | **100%** ✅ |
| Hit rate | 93.3% | **96.0%** |
| Languages parsed | TS, JS, Python | + **Go** |
| Schema version | 1 | **2** |
